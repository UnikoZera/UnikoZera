## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is UnikoZera!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on MCU like STC series projects(like AI8051U or STC32G12K128) AND some STM series!(STM32C8T)
- ðŸ¤” After tasting the benefits of STM, I started to dislike STC. (maybe not really...  HAHA)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently using C && C# language, and gonna learning Python && C++ with VSC!
- I'm very busy at times,, but I am very happy to make friends or discuss technical matters in depth!
